## Materials and Equipment

For the sampling protocol we use the eDNA sampling kit from [Sylphium](https://sylphium.com/eng/) 
 as well as a car oil vacuum pump extraction [oil vacuum pump extraction](https://www.amazon.com.be/FIRSTINFO-Pressure-Patented-Extractor-Thinnest/dp/B01EN57AOG/ref=pd_rhf_se_s_ci_mcx_mr_hp_d_d_sccl_1_6/259-6443971-9025643?pd_rd_w=MxJk1&content-id=amzn1.sym.317fe9bc-40a2-4f67-9e00-2333850193dd%3Aamzn1.symc.1b44a113-f80b-4bad-946d-45e84e3d8ccf&pf_rd_p=317fe9bc-40a2-4f67-9e00-2333850193dd&pf_rd_r=94VM0MEDW2GZ011H7ZBH&pd_rd_wg=Z1oH5&pd_rd_r=cd129295-10d9-4b4f-a9e9-869e5034260c&pd_rd_i=B01EN57AOG&psc=1&language=en_GB) 

## Sampling protocol 

For cave environment it ask to sample 3 area of the cave 

- A percolation (accumulation outside of rivers)
- The underground river 
- The spring of the cave (exit of the cave's river)
- A blank

For each site, 3 replicates of at least 5-10 litter should be done. 

For each cave, a sampling blank has to be done. The blank consist of filtering at least 5-10 liters of ultra pure water after entering the cave and has to be filtered during the first sampling activity.
